### 💻 Cursor - Integration, Testing & Week 2 Foundation
**Role**: Codebase analysis, integration, performance insights, systematic execution

**Status**: ⏳ **IN PROGRESS** - Working through massive 80-task workload

**Completed Work** (per CURSOR-PARALLEL-WORK-REPORT.md):
- ✅ Fixed encoding issues (literal `\n` characters)
  - LiquidLightBackground.tsx
  - ProductionLiquidEngine.tsx
  - lib/audio/useAudioReactive.ts
  - hooks/useAudioReactiveEngine.ts
  - lib/post/ThinFilmPass.tsx

- ✅ Created complementary services:
  - lib/visual/types.ts (TypeScript interfaces)
  - lib/visual/CapabilityDetector.ts (formalized detection)
  - lib/visual/index.ts (clean exports)

- ✅ Fixed component issues:
  - DesktopAppShell.tsx JSX structure

**Assigned Workload** (CURSOR-MASSIVE-TODO-LIST.md):
- 🔥 **Workstream 1**: Week 1 Integration Sprint (15 tasks) - CRITICAL
- 🔥 **Workstream 2**: Week 2 Orchestration (20 tasks) - HIGH
- 📝 **Workstream 3**: Code Quality (12 tasks) - MEDIUM
- 📝 **Workstream 4**: Documentation (8 tasks) - MEDIUM
- ⚡ **Workstream 5**: Error Handling (8 tasks) - MEDIUM
- 🎨 **Workstream 6**: Cultural Prep (5 tasks) - MEDIUM
- ⚡ **Workstream 7**: Performance Deep Dive (7 tasks) - MEDIUM
- 🧪 **Workstream 8**: Testing Infrastructure (5 tasks) - LOW

**Total**: 80 tasks

**Current Focus**: Week 1 integration tasks (integrating services, testing, mounting controls)

**Next**: Continue through workstream priorities

### 🔧 Codex CLI - Week 2 Architecture Preparation & Utilities
**Role**: Systematic patterns, orchestration design, architectural planning

**Status**: 🟡 **IN PROGRESS** - Utilities implemented, wiring next

**Completed (today)**:
- ✅ Core utilities added
  - `lib/visual/utils/dprClamp.ts` — `getClampedDPR`, `applyDPRToCanvas`
  - `lib/visual/performance/tierTransitionManager.ts` — hysteresis step up/down
  - `lib/visual/capability/batterySaverPolicy.ts` — force LOW/MEDIUM rules
  - `lib/visual/index.ts` — exports for above utilities

**Previously prepared**:
- Visual orchestration foundations exist (`lib/visual/*`) including `VisualPolicy`, `VisualOrchestrator`, `PerformanceMonitor`, `LayerCoordinator`, and consolidated `types.ts` (by Cursor and earlier work)

**Next (wiring, safe scope)**:
1. Integrate TierTransitionManager with existing `PerformanceMonitor`
2. Add battery saver check into orchestrator policy application
3. Apply DPR clamping in canvas-based layers (non-breaking)

**Why No Conflicts**:
- Works in new `lib/visual/` directory
- Week 2 preparation (doesn't affect Week 1)
- Additive only (no modifications to existing work)
- Architectural patterns (complements implementation)

**Timeline**: Wiring in next pass (1–2 hours)

**Next**: Begin systematic architecture design
