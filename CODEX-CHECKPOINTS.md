CODEX Checkpoints

Purpose: Lightweight, in-repo breadcrumb so interruptions don’t lose context. Each entry captures what changed, what’s next, and any flags to resume quickly.

Format
- Timestamp: ISO local
- Scope: Area touched
- Done: Brief bullet list
- Next: Actionable next steps
- Notes: Decisions, flags, or blockers

Entries

2025-10-30T00:15:00Z
- Scope: Orchestrator safeguards + docs
- Done:
  - Added memory monitor loop in VisualOrchestrator (10s check, >100MB → disable thin-film or tier down)
  - Verified LiquidLightControls already provides thin-film + audio controls
  - Updated orchestrator README with controls and memory notes
- Next:
  - Consider centralizing thin-film FPS gating within layerCoordinator (optional)
  - Add a small unit test for VisualPolicy persistence of new fields
- Notes: Debug HUD visible with `?debug=true`. Pure Mode respected.

2025-10-29T00:00:00Z
- Scope: Sprint setup and handoff
- Done: Added handoff docs and sprint plan; thin-film, audio, palette services from Claude integrated into repo
- Next: Start Workstream A orchestrator wiring
- Notes: See CODEX-MEGA-SPRINT-WEEKS-2-4.md (A1–A8)

2025-10-30T00:00:00Z
- Scope: Workstream A – Orchestrator wiring (initial)
- Done:
  - Implemented lib/visual/VisualOrchestrator.tsx
  - Wired enhanced audio + beat detection; palette sync
  - Mounted thin-film overlay with auto-disable <45 FPS and Pure Mode guard
  - Debug HUD shows FPS, tier, DPR, audio levels, palette
- Next:
  - Integrate TierTransitionManager into PerformanceMonitor (A13 refinement) if needed
  - Expose thin-film setters in controls/UI (A10)
  - Add orchestrator memory check loop (A14)
  - Update lib/visual/orchestrator/README.md with final wiring (A15)
- Notes: VisualPolicy already includes thinFilm* fields and localStorage persistence. ThinFilmLayer wrapper exists but main app now mounts via AuthenticThinFilmEffect in orchestrator.

How To Use
- After any significant step, add a new entry at the top with Done/Next.
- If interrupted, search this file for the most recent entry and resume the Next list.
- Optional: include a short “Resume here” comment in the sprint doc near the active task.
