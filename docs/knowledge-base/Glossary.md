### RGB
**RGB** (Red, Green, Blue) is a color model that represents colors as combinations of red, green, and blue values.

### HSL
**HSL** (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) is a color model that represents colors in terms of hue, saturation, and lightness.

### Wavelength
**Wavelength** is the distance between consecutive peaks of a wave, measured in nanometers for visible light.

### Spectral Colors
**Spectral Colors** are colors that correspond to specific wavelengths of light, such as the colors of a rainbow.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Terms

**React Three Fiber** is a React renderer for Three.js that allows you to use Three.js in a declarative way.

### Jest
**Jest** is a JavaScript testing framework that provides test runners, assertions, and mocking capabilities.

### ESLint
**ESLint** is a static code analysis tool that identifies and reports on patterns in JavaScript/TypeScript code.

### Prettier
**Prettier** is a code formatter that enforces consistent code style across a project.

## üéØ System Terms

### Singleton
**Singleton** is a design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides global access to it.

### Service Layer
**Service Layer** is an architectural pattern that encapsulates business logic and provides a clean interface for components.

### Context
**Context** in React is a way to share data between components without prop drilling.

### Hook
**Hook** in React is a function that allows you to use state and other React features in functional components.

### Effect
**Effect** in React is a function that runs after the component renders, allowing you to perform side effects.

### Ref
**Ref** in React is a way to access DOM elements or component instances directly.
