# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This document answers the most common questions about the Liquid Light System.

## üé® General Questions

### What is the Liquid Light System?
The Liquid Light System is a modern web application that creates an authentic 1960s-inspired liquid light show experience using WebGL fluid simulation, real-time audio analysis, and adaptive performance optimization.

### What technologies does it use?
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript
- **WebGL**: Three.js, React Three Fiber, webgl-fluid-enhanced
- **Audio**: Web Audio API, real-time analysis
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, CSS-in-JS
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library
- **Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript strict mode

### Is it open source?
Yes! The Liquid Light System is open source and available on GitHub. You can contribute, fork, or use it in your own projects.

### What browsers are supported?
- **Chrome**: 90+ (recommended)
- **Firefox**: 88+
- **Safari**: 14+
- **Edge**: 90+
- **Mobile**: iOS Safari 14+, Chrome Mobile 90+

### What are the system requirements?
- **RAM**: 8GB minimum, 16GB recommended
- **GPU**: WebGL2 compatible graphics card
- **CPU**: Modern multi-core processor
- **OS**: Windows 10+, macOS 10.15+, Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+)

## üéµ Audio Questions

### How does audio reactivity work?
The system uses the Web Audio API to analyze incoming audio in real-time, extracting frequency bands (bass, mids, treble), overall volume, and beat detection. This data is then mapped to fluid physics parameters like splat force, dissipation rates, and curl strength.

### Can I use my microphone?
Yes! The system can use your microphone for audio input. You'll need to grant microphone permissions when prompted.

### Can I use audio files instead?
Yes! You can play audio files and the system will react to them. Just make sure the audio element is playing and not muted.

### Why isn't the audio working?
Common causes include:
- Microphone permissions denied
- Audio context not started
- Audio element not playing
- Browser doesn't support Web Audio API

See the [Troubleshooting Guide](../troubleshooting/CommonIssues.md) for solutions.

### How do I adjust audio sensitivity?
You can adjust audio sensitivity through the `AudioBus` service:
```typescript
const audioBus = AudioBus.getInstance();
audioBus.setSensitivity(0.8); // 0-1, higher = more sensitive
```

## üé® Visual Questions

### How do I change the color palette?
Use the `PaletteDirector` service to switch palettes:
```typescript
import { PaletteDirector } from '@/lib/palette/PaletteDirector';

// Switch to a specific palette
PaletteDirector.setPalette('psychedelic_swirl');

// Get available palettes
const palettes = PaletteDirector.getAllPalettes();
```

### Can I create custom palettes?
Yes! You can add custom palettes by extending the `Authentic60sPalettes` array or creating your own palette definitions.

### Why is the screen black?
This usually indicates a WebGL context loss. The system will automatically fall back to CSS gradients. Common causes:
- Browser tab was backgrounded too long
- GPU memory issues
- Hardware acceleration disabled

### How do I adjust the visual intensity?
Use the intensity control in the `LiquidLightControls` component or set it programmatically:
```typescript
const [intensity, setIntensity] = useState(0.7); // 0-1
```

### Can I disable motion for accessibility?
Yes! The system respects `prefers-reduced-motion` and provides a motion toggle. When disabled, the fluid simulation becomes static but maintains the color palette.

## ‚ö° Performance Questions

### Why is it running slowly?
The system uses adaptive quality to maintain performance. If it's still slow:
- Check your device tier (Ultra, High, Medium, Low, Fallback)
- Reduce the intensity setting
- Close other applications
- Check for thermal throttling

### How does adaptive quality work?
The system continuously monitors FPS, CPU/GPU usage, and memory consumption. When performance drops below thresholds, it automatically reduces quality settings like resolution, particle count, and effect complexity.

### Can I force a specific quality level?
Yes! You can manually set the quality level:
```typescript
import { AdaptiveQuality } from '@/lib/performance/AdaptiveQuality';

const quality = new AdaptiveQuality();
quality.setDeviceTier(DeviceTier.HIGH);
```

### What's the difference between quality tiers?
- **Ultra**: Full resolution, all effects, maximum particles
- **High**: 80% resolution, reduced particles, most effects
- **Medium**: 70% resolution, fewer particles, basic effects
- **Low**: 60% resolution, minimal particles, essential effects
- **Fallback**: CSS-only gradients, no WebGL

3. Ensure audio element is playing
4. Check browser Web Audio API support

### Performance is poor
1. Check device tier and quality settings
2. Monitor CPU/GPU usage
3. Look for memory leaks
4. Verify adaptive quality is working

### Tests are failing
1. Check Jest configuration
2. Verify test file patterns
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed

## üîß Technical Questions

### How does WebGL optimization work?
The system uses several WebGL2 optimizations:
- FBO (Framebuffer Object) reuse
- Instanced rendering
- Shader pre-compilation
- Geometry merging
- Texture optimization

### How does memory management work?
The `GPUMemoryManager` tracks all WebGL objects and automatically disposes of them when no longer needed. This prevents memory leaks and ensures smooth performance.

### How does beat detection work?
The system uses a combination of frequency analysis and transient detection to identify musical beats. It analyzes the audio signal for sudden increases in energy that typically indicate beats.

### How does color mapping work?
Colors are managed through the `PaletteDirector` service, which provides:
- Authentic 60s color palettes
- Wavelength-to-RGB conversion
- Intensity scaling
- Dynamic palette switching
